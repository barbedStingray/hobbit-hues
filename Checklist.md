## Overall Goals and Functionalities for Hobbit Hues

BASE FUNCTIONALITY ACHIEVED
community page? How do I optimize it for 100's of projects?
what is the difference between code inside the componenet vs outside of it?



## Rounding Out the Project

[] About Page
    [] about the app, why it was created, what it's useful for
    [] describe your personal connection to it

[] Info Page
    [] desctiptions of the techniques
    [] how to use it
    [] clarify parts that may be less specific


## Stretch Goals
    [] community page displaying a list of ALL projects. 
    [] ability to toggle public/private projects from the user (think boolean column in "projects" sql)

## Bug Hunt
    [] animations for projectItems and paintItems do not animate upon first view, but every
        time after they work fine
    [] css background image / viewport relationship is slightly askew
    [] make sure item renders are ordered the way you need (GET requests alphabetical)
    [] scroll divs affect the heights awkwardly (maybe left to right scrolls?)
