## Overall Goals and Functionalities for Hobbit Hues

BASE FUNCTIONALITY ACHIEVED

## Bug Hunt
    [] animations for projectItems and paintItems do not animate upon first view, but every time after they work fine
    [] projectDetails and communityDetails title "flash" into focus upon changing the state of the reducer while animation is playing
    [] css background image / viewport relationship is slightly askew... slightly, in relation to height
    [] delay in loading pages seems to happen inconsistently. Unknown cause.
